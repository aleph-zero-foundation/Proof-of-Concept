Tweakable parameters:

    *   #create / s
    *   #sync / s
    *   N parents (unit)
    *   #TXs / unit



Packages (code layout and modularization):

    *   Network environment
    *   Threshold coin
    *   Cryptographic primitives
    *   Poset (data structure)

    *   Sync
    *   Create + update
    *   SNAP
    *   BTS


Read, research, think:

    *   networking library
    *   concurrency library
    *   testing environment
    *   TX model
    *   adversary model
    *   threshold coin
